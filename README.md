To gain some experience with [re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame), I adapt my [old repo](https://github.com/formsandlines/notion-clone-tut-in-cljs) to use re-frame for de-complected state management instead of pure Reagent r/atoms.

My original repo was based on the tutorial [“How To Build A Text Editor Like Notion”](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-build-a-text-editor-like-notion-c510aedfdfcc) by konstantinmuenster, but I will make more drastic changes to the code structure and maybe add new features.
