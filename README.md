My attempt to translate the tutorial [“How To Build A Text Editor Like Notion”](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-build-a-text-editor-like-notion-c510aedfdfcc) by konstantinmuenster to ClojureScript using Reagent to learn more about interop and differences from pure React.

For now this is just the code, but I may put it together with the actual tutorial text (which would have to be adapted as well) if people are interested and I get permission from the author.

I might also try to port his [full stack Notion Clone](https://github.com/konstantinmuenster/notion-clone) to CLJ/CLJS in the future, when I learn how to do this backend stuff in Clojure.
